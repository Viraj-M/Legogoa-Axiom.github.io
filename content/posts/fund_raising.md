In the true spirit of FIRST, three team members of Legogoa Axi0m 22855 decided to combine outreach and raising funds into one event and they did it successfully by conducting a nominally paid robotics workshop called â€œExplore the World of Robotics. 

The team members, Venkatesh Dempo, Shounak Hede and Dhruv Desai (aka Team VSD) conducted their first workshop on 4th December, 2022 at Goa's capital city of Panaji and their second workshop on 8th December, 2022 at Margao. 12 students each in the age group of 7 to 13 years attended the workshop. The duration of the workshop was 3 hours and each student was charged a fee of Rs. 500. 

The workshop started with a brief introduction of the trainers and the purpose of the workshop and FTC. The participants were made aware of the basics of coding through a Powerpoint presentation. The participants were then taught to create a robot using Lego EV3 kit and then program the robot to perform a specific task.

The aim of the workshops was to create awareness and enthusiasm amongst young participants about the world of Robotics and to give them hands-on experience in assembling a robot and coding it. The participants displayed keen interest in learning and exploring new things.

In true spirit of FIRST the trio raised Rs 12,000/- for the team via the fees received from the participants.

The workshops were well appreciated by young participants and their parents. The trio thanked the participants for supporting their initiative of fundraising for the FTC championship.
